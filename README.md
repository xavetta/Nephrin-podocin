# Codes used in the publications "Podocin oligomers regulate the ordering of nephrin chains, providing the molecular basis of _NPHS2_ interallelic interactions"
This repository containes the codes and raw images used for the image processing and data analysis in the publication "Podocin oligomers regulate the ordering of nephrin chains, providing the molecular basis of _NPHS2_ interallelic interactions". The FRET efficiency data can be found as supplementary for the original article.

# Confocal microscopy
Confocal images used for the quantification of membrane localization can be found in the "Raw_images" folder. 
The perimembranous region was defined by delimitating WGA-labeled membrane extensions using Fiji (ImageJ) software. 
The membrane-targeting of nephrin and podocin was characterized by the ratio of the WGA-labeled perimembranous area which colocalized with nephrin or podocin, and was quantified as the Manders' coefficient calculated by Fiji (ImageJ) JaCoP plugin.

# Image processing
For image processing we used the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Fiji.html).
We determined with an ImageJ macro the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient from selected and cropped images, that displayed only one cell. 
The algorithm is based on the work of Moser et al. (2016). (https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201600332)
The macro uses two channels to determine colocalization (termed C1 and C2), and a third that marks the cell membrane (C3).
The background is subtracted after thresholding from each channel with triangle dark algorithm; outside the thresholded objects the image is cleared.
Following this, the channels are normalized to the intensity range to compensate for potential differences in the intensity of the channels.
The Pearson's correlation coefficient is calculated by Coloc2 plugin.
The resulting Log.txt file is processed with a Python algorithm.
(Images to run the macro can be find in the coloc_sample folder)

# Data analysis and visualization
Statistical analyses were mainly performed by Statistica software version 13.5 (Tibco Software). Renal survival rates related to different _NPHS2_ variants were compared by paired logrank test (Python 3.9.18., JupyterLab 3.6.7, Lifelines 0.29.0) with Bonferroni correction. Figures were made in JupyterLab 3.6.7 version with Matplotlib 3.7.1 and Seaborn 0.13.2 (Python 3.9.18).
